This is a quick little modded version of the game "One trillion free draws" by ducdat0507 with no card level cost scaling as the name implies

Disclaimers:
1. This is very low effort, like, ridiculously low effort.
2. The original game can be found at https://github.com/ducdat0507/gacha/ Please go play it.
3. Legal shenaigans, ugh. The original game is licensed under MIT, and this modification will also be. No laws were broken by publishing this.
