This is a quick little modded version of the game "One Trillion Free Draws" by ducdat0507

Current changes incldude:

No card cost scaling (can be reverted by downloading card.js from the original repository an overriding it in js/consts

1e300 draws (Can be changed to any amount (between -1.79e308 to 1 Trillion, the lower, the more draws!) by changing the value of "cardsDrawn" in js/consts/data.js)
(I genuinely dont know why, but this one only works when you download the game, if anyone can find out why please open an issue)

Disclaimers:
1. This is very low effort, like, ridiculously low effort.
2. The original game can be found at https://github.com/ducdat0507/gacha/ Please go play it.
3. Legal shenaigans, ugh. The original game is licensed under MIT, and this modification will also be. No laws were broken by publishing this.
